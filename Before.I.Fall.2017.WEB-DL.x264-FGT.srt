1
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,865
<i>Maybe for you
there's a tomorrow.</i>

2
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:24,716
<i>Maybe for you,
there's 1,000 or 3,000...</i>

3
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,519
<i>Or ten.</i>

4
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,001
<i>So much time,
you can bathe in it.</i>

5
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,643
<i>So much time, you can waste it.</i>

6
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,920
<i>But for some of us,
there's only today.</i>

7
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,257
<i>And what you do today matters...</i>

8
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,659
<i>In the moment...</i>

9
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,829
<i>And maybe into infinity.</i>

10
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,274
<i>But I didn't know any of that
until right before I fell.</i>

11
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:30,148
<i>The thing is,
they don't get to know.</i>

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,851
<i>You don't wake up with a bad
feeling in your stomach</i>

13
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,186
<i>or see shadows move.</i>

14
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,988
<i>If you're like me,</i>

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,225
<i>you wake up
24 minutes and 47 seconds</i>

16
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,128
<i>before your best friend is
supposed to be picking you up.</i>

17
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,867
<i>If you're like me,
your last day starts like this.</i>

18
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,616
Outside at 2:00.

19
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,519
Well, I'll let you know by noon.

20
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,121
Well, I can't organize a playdate...
you want something to eat?

21
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,190
Nope. Good.

22
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,226
Sammy, you like
the bird I made you?

23
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,594
Morning.

24
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,565
Sammy!
What?

25
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,467
You forgot your gloves.

26
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,703
Izzy, how many times do I have to tell you?
Don't touch my stuff.

27
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,273
Go back inside.
It's cold.

28
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,981
Hey, sexy.
Hi.

29
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,716
Get in.
Okay.

30
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,929
I love the sky on
mornings like this. Hey.

31
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,398
Greasy forehead.
Window. Off.

32
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,838
I'm gonna try not to be depressed
because I'm single on cupid day.

33
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,173
That's Valentine's day to you!

34
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,943
Have insomnia
or something, Linds?

35
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,078
- Excuse me?
- It's just cute

36
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,514
- that you get up before us to get breakfast.
- Ooh.

37
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,784
- Did she just call me cute, Kingston?
- I believe she did, Edgecombe.

38
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,987
Al, Linds doesn't do "cute."
No.

39
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,857
- It's not in her lexicon.
- Lexicon? Nice word choice.

40
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,863
Whoo!

41
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,764
Come on.

42
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,374
Seriously?

43
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,444
This was maybe funny the first
bazillion times you did it.

44
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,112
Still funny.
Still is.

45
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,814
Still funny.

46
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,752
Go, baby! Yeah!

47
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,525
No texting and driving.

48
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,995
Don't worry. I'd never let
my best friend die a virgin.

49
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,565
You didn't think
we'd forget, did you?

50
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,034
It's the big day.
Opening night.

51
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,871
Rob texted me. He said, "I
made my bed for you." Ugh!

52
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,573
That is so sweet.

53
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,142
No glove, no love.

54
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,977
You hear me?
Take it!

55
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,746
Take it! Take it!

56
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,215
Take it!
Take it! Take it! Take it!

57
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,317
Okay, okay, okay. Watch the road.
Oh, my god.

58
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,152
All right. It's fine.
We're fine. We're fine.

59
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,255
Crazy.
We're freakin' fine.

60
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,158
How many roses did you
get last year, Linds?

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,660
Twenty-two.

62
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,562
I'm going for 25
this year, though,

63
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,999
and more than one of them
better be from Patrick.

64
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,967
Did I tell you I sat next to Rob

65
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,137
and I had to make him
fill out the request form?

66
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,072
It was depressing.

67
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,907
I'd be happy with 15.

68
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,677
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

69
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,146
Last year, Matt literally
sent me a dozen red roses.

70
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,815
Matt? Oh, come on.

71
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,119
You just spent a whole week crying
in the same pair of sweatpants,

72
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,854
and it got dark.

73
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,990
We're not going back there. No,
I've told you a thousand times.

74
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,092
I'll say it again.

75
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,928
You do not need
that loser. Honestly.

76
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,096
Mm-mmm.

77
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,798
You got your real baes here.
Mm-hmm.

78
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,633
We love you. Come here.

79
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,469
Till death do us part.
Even then.

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,438
Oh, get in here.

81
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
Mmm. Mmm.

82
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,675
All right, bitches, let's move.

83
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,380
Sisyphus.

84
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,783
Not an std.

85
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,886
What's he like?

86
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:12,323
What does it mean when something
is described as being Sisyphean?

87
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,460
Does it mean pointless?

88
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,395
Brave?

89
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,732
Late?

90
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,301
Ah... sorry. It was an
emergency in the<i> tribulation.</i>

91
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,572
It was a minor
laserjet explosion.

92
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,973
I hope the printer survived.

93
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,711
All right, back to Sisyphus.

94
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,379
What's his character like?

95
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,381
Does he learn
from pushing that Boulder,

96
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,816
and it...

97
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,651
Hey.
Val-a-gram delivery.

98
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,990
Happy cupid day.
Go ahead.

99
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,240
Relax. It's just roses.

100
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,743
Aw, no roses for Anna.

101
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,946
- That from your boy?
- It's from Rob, yeah.

102
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,381
All right, all right. Keep it down.
Keep it down, people.

103
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,350
Oh, my god!

104
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,188
It's so beautiful.

105
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,695
I'm in heteronormative hell.

106
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,605
Okay, okay, let's hope third
time's the charm. Okay?

107
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,206
Sisyphus.

108
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,612
Back to Sisyphus, class.

109
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,216
Yo, Sam.
Hey.

110
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,622
Oh, man.

111
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,092
Sam. Hey.
Hi.

112
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,461
Did you, uh... did you like it?
What?

113
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,496
Hey, so, um, big party tonight.

114
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,265
Mom is going out of town.
Whoa.

115
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,801
Huge rager, you know.
Why don't you come? Yeah?

116
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,435
I don't know what my plans are.

117
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,937
What everyone else
ends up doing.

118
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,438
See you tonight.
No.

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,973
You know the address.
Kent.

120
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,196
You hear about Anna?
- You mean bull dyke.

121
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,198
Please say she tripped
over her nose.

122
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,035
Not yet. But her girlfriend saw the snap
that we posted with her and that girl.

123
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,137
She straight up dumped her.

124
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,471
See?
What?

125
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,007
This is why I deserve
some public recognition

126
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,676
for making shit
like that happen.

127
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,111
Maybe someone should
give me a ribbon.

128
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,681
Like the ones that you used to
have hanging on your wall, Sammy.

129
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,349
Remember?
From horseback riding?

130
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,184
I was, like,
ten years old, Lindsay.

131
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,320
God, Sammy, you were
such a nerd back then.

132
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,288
Okay, but isn't it weird
how that stuff happens?

133
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,057
How things connect
in strange ways.

134
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,392
If Lindsay didn't post that
snap... she deserved it.

135
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,394
I'm just saying, it's crazy now.

136
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,064
I saw this video about chaos
in the universe. Listen.

137
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:10,068
How a bird flapping its wing in south America
can create a major rainstorm in New York.

138
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,171
Like how one person can watch a
pretentious video about chaos

139
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,840
while three other people
actually die of boredom.

140
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,643
It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so
you guys wouldn't get it anyway.

141
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,979
- Owie.
- Samantha Kingston.

142
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,380
Hi.
Hey, Rob.

143
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,048
Hey, Rob.

144
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,085
Did you get my rose?
I did...

145
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,153
Who are these ones from?
Your competition.

146
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,490
I wanna see. Sam has no competition, Rob.
You know it.

147
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,460
Okay, well, neither do I. So I guess
we're perfect for each other.

148
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,331
So you're going to that
thing at Kent's tonight?

149
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,001
- I heard he's getting a couple kegs.
I don't know. -Yes!

150
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,670
I'll text you later.
One more.

151
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,507
No, I'm eating.
Get out. Go.

152
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,209
God, they're too cute.
It's gross.

153
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,280
Oh, you guys, tonight our "wittle"
Sammy passes into womanhood.

154
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,048
I'm so proud.
Shh.

155
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,185
I hope you shaved.
Oh, my god.

156
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,589
Don't forget to pee
before and after.

157
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,859
Ah.

158
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,528
Guys. Guys,
sociopath, 12 o'clock.

159
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,766
Oh, god. Does she know
what a brush is?

160
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,967
No.

161
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,736
Norma bates.

162
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,073
Hey, did she get
her val-a-gram?

163
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,775
In chem, I was sitting
right behind her.

164
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,977
What'd she say?
Does she say anything ever?

165
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,546
What'd she do? She tossed
it right after class.

166
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,282
She really should appreciate it more. It's
probably the only rose she'll ever get.

167
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,552
Maybe it had something
to do with the card.

168
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,555
"Maybe next year,
but probably not."

169
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,316
it kinda look like you put it on
your cheeks. It's the same color.

170
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,151
Yeah.
That's the point.

171
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,023
Mmm. Love it.
It's so effin' good.

172
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,693
Can I post this one?
No.

173
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,597
Don't laugh at me.
Okay.

174
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,968
Linds?

175
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,276
Were you nervous
your first time?

176
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,849
I was too drunk to be anything.

177
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,552
Don't freak out if it hurts.

178
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,788
Especially at first.
And don't tense up,

179
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,391
'cause that only makes it worse.

180
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,693
Great. That sounds
really romantic.

181
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,129
Don't worry. It's not like
Rob is some random guy.

182
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,031
You actually like him.
Right. Yes.

183
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,533
So, everyone wants
to hook up with him.

184
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,068
Yeah.

185
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,537
Tonight everything changes.

186
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,408
Mwah. That face.

187
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,744
Baes!

188
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,647
What are you doing?

189
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,932
Fart's house
is actually kind of nice.

190
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,402
If I'd known, I would've stopped
calling him Danny Devito all year.

191
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,837
Sam and you.

192
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,365
I'm gonna go find Patrick.
Will you be okay?

193
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,402
What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.
Will you be okay?

194
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,037
Yeah.
Mwah.

195
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,414
Hey. Sam.

196
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,983
You made it.

197
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,056
Sam. Sam.
Hi!

198
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,626
Whoo!

199
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,129
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

200
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,933
How drunk are you? I'm not drunk.
Don't worry about it.

201
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,702
You know what?

202
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,406
You're the hottest girl here.
The hottest.

203
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,845
Okay, look, I'm only giving you,
like, an hour, an hour tops.

204
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,281
You know?
You text me and we'll go.

205
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,416
We're just gonna go,
just me and you.

206
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,823
Oh, my goodness.
Oh.

207
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,591
What happened?
Nothing.

208
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,760
I'll see you later, okay?

209
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,943
Elody's really
embarrassing herself.

210
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,778
Elody's a slut.

211
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,813
Lindsay's a bitch
and a drama queen.

212
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,283
I'm rich and have add.

213
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,951
Bae!

214
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,819
Bae!

215
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,788
Come on!

216
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,957
Oh, get in here, baby.

217
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,963
Patrick, can you go get me
something a little bit stronger?

218
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,865
What's the magic word?

219
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,802
Brb.
Thank you.

220
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,205
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

221
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,372
Have you?
Yes.

222
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,308
Like in Patrick's mouth?

223
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:52,977
Oops.

224
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,245
What?

225
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,647
Oh, she's so shitfaced.

226
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,217
No, you're shitfaced, shitface.

227
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,786
I can't believe
high school's almost over.

228
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,189
Well, actually, we did
it right, you know.

229
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,159
Kissed the hottest boys,
went to the sickest parties.

230
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,432
Do you think we'll
remember any of this?

231
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,369
I mean, like two years,
three years from now?

232
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,838
I won't even remember
this tomorrow.

233
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:35,786
Oh, my god.
What's she doing here?

234
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,202
Up.
Okay.

235
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,153
Hey there, sweetie.

236
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,855
Is that your first drink?

237
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,891
You really should take it easy.

238
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,634
You're a bitch!

239
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,337
Excuse me?

240
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,472
Whoa.

241
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,143
You heard me.

242
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:36,747
You're a goddamn fetched
bitch just like your mother.

243
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,250
It's no wonder
daddy left. Huh?

244
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,086
You're a bitch too.
What?

245
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,988
You're a drunk.

246
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,156
And you...

247
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,327
You're just pathetic.

248
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,262
You know what? We'd rather
be bitches than a psycho.

249
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,430
Yeah, psycho.

250
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,499
Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

251
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,867
Psycho.
Psycho.

252
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,471
Did anyone at this party...
Has anyone talked to you?

253
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,039
I don't think so.
You weren't even invited.

254
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,642
That's 'cause you're a freak.
Go back to the ward.

255
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,043
Go home.

256
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,382
Go home.

257
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,389
Get off me!
Get her off me!

258
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,791
Who are you?

259
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,259
Get out of here!

260
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,298
Psycho!

261
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Psycho!

262
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,069
Get this bitch on a leash!

263
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,504
Psycho!

264
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,006
- You wanna go?
- Freak!

265
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,808
Get out of here!

266
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,143
What the fuck?

267
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,814
Go!

268
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,525
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

269
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:58,829
Are you okay?

270
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,573
What the hell
was that about? Huh?

271
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,575
I don't know.
She just called us bitches.

272
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,411
What did she do?
So you attack her?

273
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,413
This is not my fault.
You throw beer all over her?

274
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,914
You know what?

275
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,084
Who are you...
Do not touch me.

276
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,055
Your boyfriend's throwing up in my sink.
You wanna take care of that?

277
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,535
Come on.
Come on!

278
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,883
That was insane.

279
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,386
I'm sorry about Rob, bae.

280
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,822
Music!

281
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,425
Pacific northwest, my ass.

282
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,394
I hate this weather.

283
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,330
Do you guys want to get some food?
I really need carbs.

284
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,132
You sound like my grandmother.

285
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,234
Meow.
Meow.

286
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,903
Oh, I like this song.

287
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,614
She called us bitches.

288
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,552
I guess we are.

289
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,689
What time is it?

290
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,791
Did you see
that look in her eyes?

291
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,294
- I mean, she just snapped.
- Yeah.

292
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,896
She freaked me out.

293
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,491
Sam, you're 20 minutes late!

294
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,091
Sammy, you like
the bird I made you?

295
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,926
Mommy says you have to get up.

296
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,028
It's Saturday.

297
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,566
Mommy, Sammy won't get up.

298
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,935
Don't make me come up there.

299
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,490
Yeah?

300
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,892
Sexy lady!

301
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,596
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

302
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,765
I had a nightmare,
so it's like a slow start.

303
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,669
Um, what happened last night?

304
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,072
Oh. Sorry.

305
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,974
I was facetiming with Patrick

306
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,809
till, like, 3:00.

307
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,444
Speaking of which,

308
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,680
are you nervous for tonight?

309
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,949
What?

310
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,020
You, Rob, his flannel sheets?

311
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,857
- I'm gonna shower.
- No. No time.

312
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,492
Come on. It's cupid day.

313
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,167
Whoo!

314
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,885
Seriously? This was maybe funny the
first bazillion times you did it.

315
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,320
Still funny.

316
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,291
Nice tits!

317
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,532
Ohh, I have your present.

318
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:05,736
No glove, no love.
You hear me?

319
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,538
It goes on him.

320
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,418
Sisyphus.

321
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,686
Not an std.

322
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,089
All right, all right,
keep it down, people.

323
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,731
- It's so beautiful.
- -I'm in heteronormative hell.

324
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,599
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

325
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,701
Okay, let's hope
third time's the charm.

326
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,003
Yo, Sam.

327
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,412
Oh, man.

328
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,848
Sam. You forgot this one.

329
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,617
No, I didn't forget it.
What do you mean?

330
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,019
The more roses you get on cupid day,
the more popular you are, right?

331
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,589
Thanks for the tip,
Kent. Noted.

332
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,858
I didn't say
the rose was from me.

333
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,865
But it<i> is</i> from you, right?

334
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,869
Well, i...

335
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,372
I... anyway, my mom's
out of town...

336
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,975
Out of town and you're
having a party?

337
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,277
Yeah. Do you wanna...
You wanna come or...

338
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,781
I have to go. Well, can
I see you tonight? Or...

339
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,100
<i>What we do?</i>

340
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,070
You're nervous?

341
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,406
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

342
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,244
You don't wanna waste the first
night you go full womanhood.

343
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh!
Yeah!

344
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,116
Do I look good? I just really don't
wanna look like I'm trying too hard.

345
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,751
You're fine.

346
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,423
Such a weird day.

347
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,526
Like how?
Just weird.

348
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,995
I feel like I'm still
dreaming from yesterday.

349
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:16,333
Like... or maybe
yesterday was the dream.

350
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,101
I don't know.
You're awake now!

351
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,304
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my god!

352
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,673
No, don't you... don't... don't do that.
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,576
I'm gonna go find Patrick, you guys.
Mwah!

354
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,448
Sam!

355
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,583
Hey, you made it.

356
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,158
Sam. Sam.

357
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,264
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

358
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,599
Rob, I need to talk to you.
About what? What's up?

359
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,868
I'm feeling pranked.

360
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,204
Tonight was supposed to be our
special night. No, no, no, no.

361
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,538
Rob.
What?

362
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,843
I don't feel good.
I'm freaking out.

363
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,745
Always something.
Can we go talk?

364
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,247
Always something.

365
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,050
Okay, Sam. Okay.

366
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,085
I'm gonna fill my cup up first.

367
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,354
Five minutes.
Can you wait that long?

368
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,094
This room's off-limits.

369
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,167
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

370
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,969
Sorry.

371
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:10,007
I feel like I'm having Déjà
vu with you being in my room.

372
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,610
Oh, my god. I've been having
Déjà vu all day long.

373
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,782
Are you okay?

374
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,153
Yeah.

375
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,388
Excuse me.

376
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,823
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

377
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,459
Oh, yeah?
In Patrick's mouth maybe.

378
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,632
You seem a little guilty.
Were you with Rob, you hussy?

379
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,200
Skank.
Harlot.

380
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,236
Hey, you guys talking about me?

381
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,339
You know what? I think I'm gonna go home.
No, no, no.

382
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,142
No, we just got here.
I'm confused.

383
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,078
I thought you were supposed to
get it on with Rob tonight.

384
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,312
Yeah.

385
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,682
Yeah, I changed
my, um... my mind.

386
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,152
Well, at least I'm not
gonna be the only virgin.

387
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,158
Oh, my god.

388
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,392
What's she doing here?

389
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:08,765
Watch this.

390
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,847
You're a bitch!

391
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,083
Just like your mother.

392
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,585
No wonder daddy left.
Huh?

393
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,354
You're a bitch too.
What?

394
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,523
You're a drunk.
And you...

395
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,561
You're just pathetic.

396
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,728
Juliet.
You know what?

397
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,630
We'd rather be bitches
than a psycho.

398
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,800
Psycho. Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

399
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,235
Psycho.
Psycho.

400
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,405
Did anyone at this party...
Has anyone talked to you?

401
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,906
I don't think so.
Go back to the ward.

402
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,108
Go home.

403
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,212
Go home.

404
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,549
Get off me!

405
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,057
Psycho!

406
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,459
Freak!
Get out of here!

407
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,428
Get the fuck out!

408
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,964
Psycho! Psycho!

409
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,133
Get this bitch on a leash.
Psycho!

410
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,135
You wanna go?

411
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,241
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

412
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,752
What do you think people will
say about you when you die?

413
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,687
Like I care.
I'm serious.

414
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,157
- That we're hot.
- This shit is morbid, Sam.

415
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,958
Hey, watch the road.

416
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,293
You watch the road.
We need music.

417
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,463
Guys, I'll find a song.
I want to pick a song.

418
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,931
Okay, mom.

419
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,134
Don't elbow me.
Just pick something.

420
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,803
You're trouble.
You always have to pee.

421
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,672
'Cause she drinks too much.

422
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,807
That, and she has the
bladder of a baby squirrel.

423
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,786
The truck.

424
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,354
Truck?

425
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,723
- Watch out for the truck.
- What truck?

426
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,381
<i>It wasn't a dream.</i>

427
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,383
<i>It really happened.</i>

428
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,651
<i>Again.</i>

429
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,617
Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
It's origami.

430
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,752
Mommy says you have to get up.

431
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,621
Tell mom I'm sick.

432
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,592
You don't feel hot.
Stop it.

433
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,102
Let go!

434
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,040
Mommy, Sammy won't get up!

435
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,778
<i>It wasn't until then</i>

436
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,114
<i>that I allowed myself
to think the worst.</i>

437
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,649
Sam?

438
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,151
What's this about
you feeling sick?

439
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,387
I just don't feel good.

440
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,389
On cupid day?

441
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,197
Did something happen?

442
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,735
I don't know.

443
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,073
Did you and Rob have a fight?
No.

444
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,443
Mom, go away.

445
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,745
Please don't use that tone.
I'm just trying to help.

446
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,747
I just need to sleep
a little bit longer.

447
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,150
Please?

448
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,121
Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay
know that you're going in late.

449
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,424
But I have to be
at work by 10:00.

450
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,030
- Thank you for driving me.
- Sure.

451
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,204
Sammy.
Hmm?

452
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,706
You'll feel better
once you see some of your roses.

453
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,477
I don't know.

454
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,079
Maybe.

455
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,585
Well, you're lucky
to be so popular.

456
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:32,689
I mean, when I was a senior,
I hadn't even kissed a boy.

457
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,493
Everyone said my eyes were too close
together and that I looked like a fish.

458
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,163
Yeah.

459
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,640
I have to get to work, honey.

460
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,843
I think you're beautiful.

461
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,750
Go.
Bye.

462
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,537
<i>Maybe everything</i> was<i> connected.</i>

463
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,576
<i>Maybe a flock of birds
could cause a rainstorm</i>

464
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,813
<i>and everything done
could be undone.</i>

465
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,953
<i>Maybe things could change.</i>

466
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,357
<i>And maybe I could change them.</i>

467
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,964
It's Rob.

468
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,800
We're having issues.

469
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,102
But it's the day.

470
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,738
The note in his val-a-gram
said, "luv ya."

471
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,142
"L-u-v ya." Luv ya.

472
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,277
What is that? We've been
going out since last year.

473
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,014
Yeah, well, you know, maybe he's just
waiting to say it, like, tonight.

474
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,583
I'm not gonna have sex with him

475
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,318
just so that he says,
"I love you."

476
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,586
I'm not gonna do that.

477
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:12,622
We go out every weekend. Hmm.

478
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,123
I don't know.
I wanna stay in.

479
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,625
Like we used to.

480
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,694
Okay, but the only reason
we stayed in

481
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,829
was because we weren't invited
to any senior parties.

482
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,698
I just,

483
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,101
bottom line, don't wanna have
to deal with that today.

484
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,103
Okay?

485
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,341
Okay.

486
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,343
All right.

487
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,045
- What are you doing?
- Shh, shh, shh.

488
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,814
What is she...
Don't worry.

489
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,782
Are you texting...

490
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,452
- Oh, my, god.
- That devilish grin though.

491
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,059
Why did he give me that...

492
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,028
What did you say?
Relax.

493
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,864
I just told him that you
got your period. Oh, my...

494
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,466
- That's perfect.
- That's a good one.

495
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,570
- You're welcome.
- That's a good one.

496
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,305
Lock up the knives and babies!

497
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,741
Does it smell like pee in here?

498
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:07,210
I can smell her from here.
Why do we hate Juliet?

499
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:11,381
- Are you serious?
- We don't hate her.

500
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:14,384
It's just she's super creepy,
with all those weird drawings.

501
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:17,854
Remember mellow yellow in the fifth grade?
Oh, my god.

502
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,089
When Lindsay found out that
she peed in her sleeping bag

503
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,925
on the girl scout trip.

504
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,061
Why do you care all of a sudden?

505
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,330
You know she should
be institutionalized.

506
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,599
I was just wondering.

507
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,934
That's all.

508
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:38,374
- So we're going over to your house, right?
- -Obviously.

509
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,145
- Can I borrow something?
- Always. I got you.

510
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,698
Hey. Uh, these came for
you in Daimler's class.

511
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
No, I know I'm not wearing
the appropriate attire,

512
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,702
but I promise
they're legitimate.

513
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,739
Cool.

514
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,542
Also, uh, this rose
came for you.

515
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,549
It's kind of like
a painting of a rose.

516
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,317
It stands out
in front of all the others.

517
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,389
Thank you.

518
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:30,493
Hey, I-i never said
that it was from me.

519
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,630
But whoever it was from, they put
a lot of thought into it, so...

520
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,470
By the way, my, uh, mom
is out of town this weekend,

521
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:44,073
so I'm gonna throw a big
party tonight. Yeah.

522
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,442
Did you remember the
address or you... hi, Sam.

523
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,847
It was... it was third grade,
but probably don't remember.

524
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,684
But, uh... but do you, uh...
You think you'll come or...

525
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,919
No, I can't. Sorry.

526
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,188
Oh, come on.

527
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,859
Well, I'm... I could have, uh,
crutches on call for you...

528
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,861
Kent. In case you want
to climb up the tree

529
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,829
and play flying squirrel.
That was one time.

530
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,965
Look, I'm just saying,
I'm pre... I'm prepared.

531
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,533
I'm prepared.
Okay, glad to hear it.

532
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,768
So that's a maybe or...

533
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,836
Uh...

534
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,872
I don't think so.

535
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,540
Well, I'll take that "no"
as a "maybe."

536
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,176
So maybe I'll see you tonight.

537
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,055
<i>What we do?</i>

538
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,693
Oh, god.

539
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,795
Juliet Sykes just
arrived at the party.

540
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,496
- Gross.
- Yeah.

541
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,199
The worst. I'm so
glad we didn't go.

542
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,468
Mm. Snapchat alert:

543
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,137
- Rob is totally puking in the kitchen sink.
- Oh, I wanna see that.

544
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,206
Could I see that?

545
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,808
Of course he is.

546
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,876
Ooh, I don't wanna see it.
Gross. Ew.

547
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,547
You kiss that? Mm.

548
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,315
I can't believe you
made this ice cream, ally.

549
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,050
It's literally better
than a restaurant's.

550
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,553
No, it's true. You should go to
cooking school. Screw college.

551
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,755
Thanks, guys.
It has no dairy.

552
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,391
Oh, you're so full of shit.

553
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,926
Thirty-eight.

554
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:12,862
- You can shut up now.
- What?

555
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,399
Matt's at the party.

556
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,168
Ally, you say "Matt" one more time,
and I will kill you in your sleep.

557
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,338
I will kill you in your sleep.
I will kill you in your sleep.

558
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:27,677
12:39. 12:39.

559
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,036
I wonder what filter
Terri uses on her photos.

560
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,806
- Major Fomo.
- Such a loser.

561
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,541
Steve's
flirting with a freshman.

562
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,209
I love you guys.

563
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,746
Oh, Sam.

564
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,418
- We love you too.
- Aw.

565
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,020
Weirdo.

566
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,225
Don't go emo on us.

567
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,478
Where's my phone?

568
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,087
Juliet Sykes is dead.

569
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,839
She killed herself.

570
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,444
Then nothing happened
to her at the party.

571
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:12,849
How totally insane.

572
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,859
Could our rose have something
to do with it?

573
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,460
Don't be stupid.

574
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,499
Imagine how her family feels.

575
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,501
Look, you can't be mean
to someone forever

576
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,670
and then just feel badly
when they die, okay?

577
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,472
We all knew she was crazy.

578
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,261
God, Lindsay, she was your
best friend in fifth grade.

579
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,680
Yeah, you used to sleep over her house.
I mean, you must know her...

580
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,683
Yeah, well, that was before
she became a sociopath, ally.

581
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,986
I'm going back to sleep.

582
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,063
I'm going to sleep in my room.

583
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,337
I'm going with her.

584
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,347
You were friends with Juliet?

585
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,286
No one even talked
to you in fifth grade,

586
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,855
and I don't hold that
against you.

587
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,294
You never said anything.

588
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,299
We made fun of her for all these
years... it's not our fault.

589
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,382
Go to sleep.

590
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,443
<i>I did everything right.</i>

591
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,612
<i>And nothing changed.</i>

592
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,335
Ugh!

593
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,248
<i>The day
starts and ends the same,</i>

594
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,684
<i>regardless
of anything I do or say.</i>

595
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,354
<i>If that's how it works,</i>

596
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,591
<i>I'm gonna do and say
whatever I want.</i>

597
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,478
- Oh, no, you're not wearing that to school.
- My cupid day outfit.

598
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,746
You don't want to give
people the wrong idea.

599
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,896
- What idea is that exactly?
-No, this is not happening.

600
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:41,283
 Go back up
and change, please.

601
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,220
This is my life. I'll do whatever
the hell I want with it.

602
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:47,323
Dan, can you jump in here, please?
Sam,

603
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,291
it's so disrespectful to talk
to your mom... i don't care.

604
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,660
- Sam!
- I told you not to touch my stuff!

605
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,462
That's it!
You are grounded!

606
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,631
Grounded?

607
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:56,966
I'm already grounded.

608
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,637
Samantha!

609
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:06,275
<i>Maybe I was dead and in hell.</i>

610
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,145
<i>Maybe I was alive and in hell.</i>

611
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:11,080
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

612
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,849
<i>Nothing mattered anymore.</i>

613
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,755
What are you wearing?

614
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,423
Funny.

615
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,961
Excuse me.

616
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,631
Geez, wake up on the wrong
side of the bed or something?

617
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,999
For a few days now, yeah.

618
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,201
You ready?
Hey.

619
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,304
Hi. Sam.

620
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,440
Someone forgot to take her
happy pills this morning.

621
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,476
I took mine.

622
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,278
Well, I know something
that'll cheer you right up.

623
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,613
I swear to god, Elody, if you
hand me a condom right now...

624
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,485
But it's your present,
for your special night.

625
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,021
Take it.

626
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,790
Unless you want to be
a walking std farm.

627
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,793
You would know.

628
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:03,832
At least I'm not still a virgin.

629
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,235
What the hell is wrong with you?

630
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,671
What did you just say to me?

631
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,508
What is it? Do you feel like you need to
prove to us that you don't give a shit?

632
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,376
Is that what it is?

633
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,645
'Cause guess what. You don't
need to prove anything.

634
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:20,149
We all know that you don't give a
damn about anybody but yourself.

635
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,017
We're all pretty
fucking clear on that.

636
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,852
What the hell is
your problem today, Sam?

637
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,388
You guys, don't fight.
Just drop it.

638
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,024
- What, you don't agree?
- Leave her out of it.

639
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,561
Why? You're the one who talks shit
about both of them all the time.

640
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:36,532
"Look at Elody climbing all over Steve.
He doesn't even like her.

641
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,835
Look at ally. Oh my, god!
She's such a know-it-all.

642
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,704
She just loves
the sound of her own voice.

643
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,406
I hope Elody doesn't puke in my car again
and make it smell like alcoholic."

644
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,175
Stop it, Sam.

645
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,146
Out.

646
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,482
Get out!

647
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,684
Now!

648
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,425
I'd love to hear what you say
about me behind my back.

649
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,083
Sisyphus. Not an std.

650
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,721
Don't say it.

651
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,127
I'm in heteronormative hell.

652
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,231
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

653
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,634
Okay, okay, let's hope
third time's the charm.

654
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,102
Okay?

655
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,404
Sisyphus.

656
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,075
Hey, what?
You can take 'em.

657
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,411
Oh, Sam, you're breaking
hearts left and right.

658
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,252
Am I breaking yours,
Mr. Daimler?

659
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,422
What?

660
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,159
Your heart.

661
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,760
Am I breaking it?

662
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,038
No, you're not.

663
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,674
My Patience, however,
is at its breaking point.

664
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,643
Take a seat.

665
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,944
Please.

666
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,313
If you insist.

667
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,283
Oh, my god.

668
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:38,454
Okay. Sisyphus.

669
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,192
Sisyphus.

670
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,527
Why is our friend Sisyphus
still relevant today?

671
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,796
Why's his story
still relevant today?

672
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:14,149
<i>Get this bitch on a leash!</i>

673
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,819
- Psycho!
- Psycho!

674
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,494
What the hell?
Shit!

675
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,463
What are you doing in here?

676
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,069
This is my bathroom.

677
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,075
Nice shoes.

678
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,078
Hard to walk in, huh?

679
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,913
I can walk in them
just fine, thank you.

680
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,182
Ah, you need a pair of these.

681
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,853
Comfiest shoes I ever owned.
Really?

682
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,788
All right, your loss.
Whatever.

683
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,357
You wanna trade?

684
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,925
Like switch shoes?

685
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,196
Come on, Kingston. See if I
can get in those without...

686
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,832
Just get out if... hurting myself.
Come on, let's try it.

687
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,834
Why not?
What?

688
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,202
Yeah, let's do it.

689
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,204
Come on!

690
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,774
Why do you guys hate me so much?

691
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,548
I know you know what's written
in this bathroom somewhere.

692
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,687
It's "ac..."

693
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:30,459
"Equals..."
"BD," right?

694
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:34,563
Anna Cartulo equals bull dyke.

695
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,232
I mean or maybe it's
"biggest douchebag."

696
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:43,038
But I reckon that honor definitely
belongs to Lindsay Edgecombe.

697
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:50,479
So is that it?

698
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,983
'Cause I'm gay?

699
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,153
I don't know.

700
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,823
Isn't that how
it always works out?

701
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,226
There's somebody laughing, there's
somebody being laughed at.

702
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,829
Right.

703
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,067
Look, whatever, really.

704
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:16,838
I mean, this whole high school
thing's just a blip.

705
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,476
I'm not gonna remember
any of you.

706
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,148
I win.

707
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:36,258
Do you ever feel like you're living
the same day over and over again

708
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,529
with only like a few things
being different?

709
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,503
Aw, shit, Samantha. You just
described my whole life!

710
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,448
Sam.
Stop it.

711
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,978
Hi, Sam.

712
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,080
You have to ask permission
to talk to me?

713
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,787
Lindsay's just really upset about
what you said. You should apologize.

714
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,356
Well, everything that
I said was true, so...

715
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,192
It doesn't matter if it's true.

716
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,195
She's Lindsay. She's ours.
We're each other's, you know?

717
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,932
Just apologize. You're not listening to me.
I'm not sorry.

718
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,435
Please, Sam?

719
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,937
What? Why do you care
so much, Elody?

720
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,107
Because...

721
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:02,177
You guys are all I have.

722
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,962
Are you still trying to
turn her against me?

723
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,071
You're the horrible driver.

724
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,873
You're the one who's always criticizing
people and hurting people.

725
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,243
You're the one who lied about being friends
with her and then tortured her for years.

726
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,279
I just followed along,
and yet...

727
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,285
I'm the one paying for it.

728
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,758
Sam, what are you talking about?
Whoa. What?

729
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,228
Oh, my god.

730
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,771
Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Where have you...

731
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,520
No!

732
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,964
Get this bitch on a leash!

733
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,933
I love you. Is that what
you wanted to hear?

734
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,565
Sam?

735
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,085
Hey, are...
Are you okay?

736
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:30,192
I mean, obviously you're crying.
Is there something I can do?

737
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:32,427
I'll get you a tissue.
Yeah, yeah. Um...

738
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,097
Hey, here.
Thanks.

739
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,866
Yeah.

740
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,709
Sorry I'm in your room.
I know there's a sign.

741
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:50,946
No, don't worry
about it. I...

742
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:53,882
The sign's just really for other
people so they don't get my stuff.

743
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:59,321
It's the first big party
I've ever had, so...

744
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,122
Why'd you have one now?

745
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:06,294
I figured if I had a party,
you'd come.

746
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,307
I like your room.
Yeah?

747
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,142
It's my dad's old den.

748
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,913
It must get a lot of light.

749
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,549
Yeah. It's like, uh...

750
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,484
Like waking up
in the middle of the sun.

751
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,256
I get to see the old tree.

752
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:37,325
I like it.
It's... it's constant.

753
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,396
Is that the one
we used to sit in?

754
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:46,768
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

755
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,771
Do you, uh... do you
remember climbing up it?

756
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,774
And then you jumped down
and sprained your ankle?

757
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:55,777
I was stupid.

758
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:57,846
It was very ambitious.

759
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,751
- I should go.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

760
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:05,186
Just stay for a second, okay?

761
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:12,294
I-I can... I can
drive you home or...

762
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:14,029
I don't want to go home.

763
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:21,503
Okay, well, you can, uh... you
could crash here if you want.

764
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,907
Not, not, not like...
Like with me. I...

765
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,643
Somewhere else.
I'll-I'll be somewhere else.

766
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:32,113
Like bed,
completely to yourself.

767
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,116
The Kent Mcfuller master suite.

768
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:41,189
Yeah?

769
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,558
Okay.

770
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:47,529
Hey, it's okay.

771
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:56,571
Here.

772
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,550
I'm sorry about earlier.

773
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,220
Don't worry about it.
No, I'm sorry...

774
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,423
I've always been so mean to you.

775
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,765
Don't look. Don't read it.
Please? Why? It's...

776
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:25,333
It's something bad.

777
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:28,870
Okay.

778
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,444
Your skin's so hot.

779
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:40,515
It's, uh...
It's always like that.

780
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,298
I wish we could be here forever.

781
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:18,420
Okay, let's try again.
Hmm.

782
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,855
Aah.

783
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,326
We're taking a day off.

784
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,830
I think you're just
going to drool around.

785
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:33,001
What does that... and then you're just
going to go through there and end up here.

786
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:35,670
<i>If I was going to relive
the same day over and over...</i>

787
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,107
<i>I wanted it to be a worthy day.</i>

788
01:04:47,616 --> 01:04:49,517
<i>But not just for me.</i>

789
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:10,672
Do the kids at school ever make fun
of you for the way that you talk?

790
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,043
Sometimes.

791
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:19,547
<i>You can do something about that.</i>

792
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,385
<i>You know, you can learn
to talk differently.</i>

793
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,722
But this is my voice. How can
they even know it's me talking?

794
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,826
When I was in the fifth grade,

795
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,897
this girl used to
sing this song...

796
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,239
who did that?

797
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,142
Lindsay.

798
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,315
<i>How come you're so mean to mom?</i>

799
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,089
I'm not mean to mom.

800
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:04,592
You drew a line on the floor with nail
Polish and said you couldn't cross it.

801
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:10,765
Mom and I had a fight, and I was mad
at her in the moment, but I didn't...

802
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,737
I didn't think that
she'd actually stay away.

803
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:23,444
<i>Look at that.</i>

804
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,480
What? That's just the
outside, how pretty it was.

805
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,183
Oh, my gosh. Look at you guys.
Can you send those to me?

806
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:30,852
Oh! Those are beautiful.

807
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:33,488
Remember when you used to
come here all the time?

808
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,356
I do. Of course.

809
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,526
Then your daughter
got too cool, so...

810
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:40,495
- I'm just kidding.
- Can we go watch the pizza?

811
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,131
Okay. Wait, tiger.

812
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:49,904
I'm glad we did this.

813
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:52,006
Yeah.

814
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,775
It was just really sweet
what you did today.

815
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,288
Do you think I'm a good person?

816
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:06,721
Of course I think you're
a good person.

817
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,724
But it doesn't really matter
what I think.

818
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,593
I mean, what's important
is what you think.

819
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:13,328
No, I'm serious.
I want to know...

820
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,131
Why do you think that
I'm a good person?

821
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:26,874
Do you remember when
you were a little girl,

822
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,245
you used to take turns riding
all of the horses in the stable

823
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,580
so that none of them
would feel left out?

824
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,582
Do you remember that?

825
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:36,517
I do.
Mm-hmm.

826
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,688
But I was a little girl.

827
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,690
It's different.

828
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,860
You have a big heart, Sam.
That doesn't go away.

829
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,031
One good thing.

830
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:54,802
You just focus on
that one good thing,

831
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,771
and you see where it leads you.

832
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,087
<i>How is it possible
to change so much</i>

833
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,523
<i>and not be able to change
anything at all?</i>

834
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:26,134
<i>I knew I had to do something.</i>

835
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,871
<i>Something good.</i>

836
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,099
Whoo!

837
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,692
You made it.

838
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:26,961
Oh, sorry.

839
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,996
The room's off-limits.

840
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,166
Oh, forget the sign.
It's no big deal.

841
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,303
That's really just there for other
people so they don't mess with my stuff.

842
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:40,074
I'm glad you came.
Yeah. I had to.

843
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:41,376
I like what you've
done with the place.

844
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:45,880
Yeah. Yeah, this used
to be my dad's old den.

845
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:49,016
Now it's the, uh... the Kent
Mcfuller master suite.

846
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,487
Yeah, not so good
in the morning, though.

847
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:57,425
- It's like waking up...
- In the middle of the sun.

848
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,731
Yeah.

849
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:15,109
I hope you don't think that it's weird
that I'm here with you right now.

850
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,312
Sam, um...

851
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:23,518
I once wore crocs
for 365 days straight,

852
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,221
so I don't think
anything's weird.

853
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,258
I forgot about your crocs phase.
Yeah.

854
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,034
Why are you always
so nice to me?

855
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,708
Uh, well...

856
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,245
Do you remember in third grade

857
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,614
right after my dad died?

858
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:59,454
We were in the cafeteria
and I was crying.

859
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:04,892
And Phil Howe came up to me,
called me a baby,

860
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:08,329
and then smacked my tray
right out of my hand,

861
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:11,632
and food went flying everywhere.

862
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,602
I remember what
we were eating too.

863
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,171
It was, um, mashed potatoes
and Turkey burgers.

864
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:21,275
And you came over,

865
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,779
you scooped up the mashed
potatoes right off the ground

866
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:29,817
and you went up to Phil and you smashed
the mashed potatoes right in his face.

867
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:35,156
And you-you then said, "you're
worse than a hot lunch,"

868
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,594
which, at the time,
was a really good insult.

869
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:43,331
I mean, I didn't laugh
more that day than...

870
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,932
I mean, uh...

871
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:52,206
It was... it was the first
time I laughed since my...

872
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,108
My dad died and i...

873
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:01,449
Do you remember
what I said to you?

874
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:10,458
"You're my hero."

875
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,859
Yeah.

876
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,198
And that day, I-i vowed
to be your hero too.

877
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,469
No matter how long it took.

878
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,815
I'm sorry.

879
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,718
No, don't do... don't be sorry.

880
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,153
It's okay.

881
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,490
Good.

882
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,593
'Cause I'm not really sorry.

883
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,785
Shit.
Wait. I...

884
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,127
Sam! Hey!

885
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,929
Sam! Wait, i...

886
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,366
Oh, my god!
Sam, did you see that?

887
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,935
Hey. Hey, Sam.

888
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,971
Did you see where Juliet went?

889
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,274
Juliet, stop!

890
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,449
Juliet!

891
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,052
Juliet! Wait!

892
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,964
Juliet!

893
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,017
Juliet!

894
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,458
Juliet!

895
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,534
Juliet.
What are you doing here?

896
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,803
I know what happened back there.
Get away from me.

897
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:11,205
And I feel really bad about it,
and I know this may sound crazy,

898
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,307
but I have a feeling I may be
able to understand you

899
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:16,477
better than you think that I could.
You hate me.

900
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:22,917
I don't hate you.

901
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:25,386
I know we haven't always
been the nicest to you,

902
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:28,923
but the thing is that Lindsay
didn't mean anything by it.

903
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:30,357
We didn't know what we were doing.
No.

904
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,528
I used to be friends
with Lindsay.

905
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,931
It was right before
her parents got divorced.

906
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:40,334
I used to sleep over at her house. Her
parents would be fighting so bad.

907
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,771
She was so upset.

908
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:49,310
She was so upset
she started wetting the bed.

909
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:54,415
You remember the name you all
gave me in fifth grade,

910
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,350
the name Lindsay gave me.

911
01:15:58,286 --> 01:16:00,788
Mellow yellow.

912
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,957
Remember that?

913
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:05,793
You remember the camping trip when I
supposedly peed in my sleeping bag?

914
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:08,295
It was Lindsay.

915
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,431
Lindsay's the one who peed.

916
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,203
When everyone asked what happened, she just
pointed her finger at me and screamed,

917
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:17,872
"she did it."

918
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,441
Juliet...

919
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,045
Please let me help you.

920
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,886
It doesn't matter now.

921
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:40,728
You...

922
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:46,801
I...

923
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:54,241
Hey, it's like
your val-a-gram always said.

924
01:16:56,611 --> 01:17:01,081
"Maybe next year, but...

925
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,518
Probably not."

926
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,188
Juliet...

927
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,835
Oh!

928
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,134
<i>For the first time,
when I wake up...</i>

929
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,304
<i>I'm not scared...</i>

930
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,207
<i>Or confused...</i>

931
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,977
<i>Or angry.</i>

932
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,351
<i>Because, for the first time,</i>

933
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:13,153
<i>I truly understand
what needs to happen.</i>

934
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:27,234
<i>I truly understand
how to live this day.</i>

935
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,944
- Uh, Friday, right?
- Yes.

936
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,849
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

937
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:44,718
You want something to eat?

938
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,454
I'm good. Thanks.
Lindsay's got it covered.

939
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,390
Mom?
Oh.

940
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,292
I love you.

941
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:53,027
I love you too.

942
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:57,197
What, no love for your old man?

943
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,267
I love you too, old man.
Thank you.

944
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:01,969
Thank you.

945
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,078
Sammy, you forgot your gloves!

946
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,314
What would I do without you?

947
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,719
Hey.

948
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:24,858
You are perfect
the way that you are, fizzy.

949
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,896
Always remember that.

950
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,671
Oh.

951
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,542
Ugh, I can't breathe!

952
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,560
It's cold!
Yeah.

953
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,668
What are you doing?

954
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,372
Auditioning for a Tampax
commercial? Let's go.

955
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:59,586
Yeah, baby!

956
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,723
Hey! Hey, get in!

957
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,995
You know how I like it.

958
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,739
Hey, Elody. What, do I have
white stuff on my face?

959
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,407
No. You know
why I love you?

960
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:25,279
I love you because you're
down for anything. Always.

961
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,581
You know I'm a down-ass bitch.

962
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:30,117
- You are.
- Hey, I'm down too.

963
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,587
No. Okay.

964
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:37,691
No, I love you, ally, because
you're curious about the world.

965
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,895
And you're passionate,
and you are driven.

966
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,897
Did someone swallow
Oprah this morning?

967
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,670
I love you, Linds.

968
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,907
I love you because
you're the kind of friend

969
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,411
that toilet papers Jason foster's house
for a week straight all by herself

970
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,173
just because he said
that I was a bad kisser.

971
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,217
Asshole.

972
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,392
Oh, uh, I think I know why
Sam's in such a good mood.

973
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:17,498
Oh.
It goes on him.

974
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:28,809
I've been looking for it
everywhere. I can't find it.

975
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,312
Thank you so much for that.

976
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,629
Sisyphus.

977
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:51,932
- Not an std. -Sorry. It was an
emergency in the<i> tribulation.</i>

978
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:54,201
A minor laserjet explosion.

979
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,436
Val-a-gram delivery.
- Happy cupid day.

980
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,040
It's so beautiful.

981
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:02,176
- I'm in heteronormative hell.
- I like your boots.

982
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:03,977
Sisyphus.

983
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:11,285
But he still thinks that he'll be
able to push that Boulder uphill.

984
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:16,557
He's in a prison of his own device.
The only escape is to change.

985
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:18,625
Be careful.

986
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,362
That.
Oh, man.

987
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,997
Sam. Hey.

988
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,399
Hey.

989
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,868
Um, "you're my hero."

990
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,570
You got a secret admirer?

991
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:31,572
Secret? That's-that's, um,

992
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:34,875
not so secret. I don't know
what you're talking about.

993
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,043
Well, um...

994
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:41,215
Hey, listen, um, I'm, uh... I'm
having a party tonight. Mm-hmm.

995
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:44,551
And I was wondering
if you maybe wanted to

996
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,386
come, maybe.

997
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,921
Yeah? No?

998
01:23:47,923 --> 01:23:50,023
What's in it for me?

999
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,827
I... what's in it for me?

1000
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:56,930
Um... yeah.

1001
01:23:56,932 --> 01:24:00,434
And, um, I have something I want
to tell you later. A secret.

1002
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:01,668
Later?
Yeah.

1003
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,503
Okay.
Okay.

1004
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,039
Wait, hey, the "you're my
hero" thing, how did you...

1005
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,176
Thank you for my beautiful rose.
I love it.

1006
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,584
What'd you say to me?

1007
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:19,586
This is not working out.

1008
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:22,222
Okay, Sam, you can't
break up with me.

1009
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:27,361
I think I can
and I-i think I just did.

1010
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:30,964
I should have picked Elody.

1011
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,805
What just happened?

1012
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:42,209
You guys were supposed to...
I mean you said you wanted to...

1013
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,147
It's Rob Cokran.

1014
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:50,984
- He doesn't deserve me.
- Nonetheless, very shocking.

1015
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:53,720
Sociopath, 12 o'clock.

1016
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:56,390
- Uh-oh.
- Does it smell like pee in here?

1017
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:57,791
Stop.

1018
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:59,526
Norma bates!
What?

1019
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:02,496
Just don't.

1020
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:05,399
- But it's Juliet.
- Exactly.

1021
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:09,436
It's Juliet. She has a
name and she is a person.

1022
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,806
Yesterday you said you were afraid she
would bite you if she got too close.

1023
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,410
That was a long time ago.

1024
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:20,414
That was yesterday.

1025
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,127
- Hey, Linds.
- All right, let's do this.

1026
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:09,496
Linds?
What?

1027
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,898
How come you never told me
about your parents' divorce?

1028
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,801
Are you serious?

1029
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,471
Yeah.

1030
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,609
Why would I talk about something
that happened a thousand years ago?

1031
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,946
Because it happened to you.

1032
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:28,548
And you matter to me.

1033
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,817
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's go inside.

1034
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,486
Come here.

1035
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:39,192
You know you don't have to act
so tough all the time.

1036
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:45,665
Don't worry about me, okay?

1037
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,904
Well, I love you no matter what.
Let's get inside.

1038
01:26:50,906 --> 01:26:52,739
Move, move, move.

1039
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:03,350
Hey, um, you made it.

1040
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:06,520
Come with me.
What? Uh, okay.

1041
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,022
Okay.

1042
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,730
I-I-i believe you
owe me a secret, right?

1043
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,198
I believe I do.

1044
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,133
Okay, so let's hear it.

1045
01:27:24,306 --> 01:27:26,039
The secret is...

1046
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:31,378
Yours was the best kiss that
I've ever had in my entire life.

1047
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:39,619
Um, but we haven't...
We haven't kissed.

1048
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:45,225
I mean,
not since the third grade.

1049
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:50,831
Better get started then.
I haven't much time.

1050
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:26,299
Because I wanted to.

1051
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:51,658
Juliet, I need to talk to you.

1052
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,961
For a second. It's okay. Please. Actually,
I kind of have somewhere I have to be.

1053
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:57,130
I know what you
have planned for tonight.

1054
01:28:57,132 --> 01:29:00,967
And I want you to know that you don't have
to do this, okay? You don't know anything.

1055
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,336
I know that you have
something to tell me.

1056
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,306
You have something to tell all of us.
You're a bitch.

1057
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:11,177
I have been a bitch.

1058
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:14,748
I have been a bitch. We all have been
bitches. And I'm sorry. I have to go.

1059
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:17,384
I'm trying to tell you how sorry...
I am sorry. You said that.

1060
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:20,020
Sorry, but I have to come with you.
Leave me alone!

1061
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:21,555
I can't.
Sam!

1062
01:29:21,557 --> 01:29:23,490
Sam, why did you run away from me?
I can't right now.

1063
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:26,760
You've been ignoring me for
years, and then you kiss me

1064
01:29:26,762 --> 01:29:30,263
and then go back to acting... i meant
everything that happened back there.

1065
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:33,700
That's all I can say, that I meant it,
and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.

1066
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:38,605
Are you in trouble?
Uh, you can... you can trust me.

1067
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:46,513
Juliet!

1068
01:29:49,383 --> 01:29:50,951
Juliet!

1069
01:29:58,527 --> 01:29:59,527
Juliet!

1070
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,441
Juliet, don't!

1071
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:17,110
Wait! Wait!

1072
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,313
Wh-what's going on?
Why are you following me?

1073
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:21,915
Why can't you leave me alone?

1074
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,050
You don't want to die.

1075
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:27,454
You want the pain to stop.

1076
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:31,725
Stop. You stop.
You... you don't know me.

1077
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:33,793
You could never understand.

1078
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,762
You have a choice, Juliet.

1079
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,263
Not everybody gets that.

1080
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,665
Sam!

1081
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:42,135
Please let me help you.

1082
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:44,804
Don't you get it?

1083
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,906
You can't help me.

1084
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:50,110
I can't be fixed.

1085
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,079
You're not the one who needs fixing.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1086
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,081
Don't let anyone
tell you that there is.

1087
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:03,923
This is just a blip. Your
life will change, Juliet,

1088
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:07,193
if you just hold on...

1089
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:09,029
For one more minute.

1090
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:18,471
It's too late for that.

1091
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,608
No, it's not.
It's never too late.

1092
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,014
Juliet, stop!

1093
01:31:41,862 --> 01:31:44,464
<i>Maybe for you,
there's a tomorrow.</i>

1094
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:48,234
<i>Maybe for you, there's 1,000...</i>

1095
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,204
<i>Or 3,000.</i>

1096
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:54,708
<i>Or ten.</i>

1097
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:00,046
<i>But for some of us,</i>

1098
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:01,715
<i>there's only today.</i>

1099
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:06,252
<i>And what you do today matters...</i>

1100
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:07,954
<i>In the moment...</i>

1101
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,158
<i>And maybe into infinity.</i>

1102
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:16,763
<i>I see only my greatest hits.</i>

1103
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,742
<i>I see the things
I want to remember...</i>

1104
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,848
<i>And be remembered for.</i>

1105
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:45,525
<i>That's when I realized that
certain moments go on forever.</i>

1106
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:51,331
<i>Even after they're over,
they still go on.</i>

1107
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,369
<i>They are the meaning.</i>

1108
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,706
Sam?

1109
01:33:01,408 --> 01:33:02,809
